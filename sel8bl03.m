% attrSelf, attrOther  : Initial belief of how where between 'negative' and 'positive' the rater 
%            is likely to be. So 1/3 means 2-to-1 'negative', 2/3 means 2-to-1 'positive'
%            It is necessary to explore / fit this!
% dEvSelf/Other (self / other, possibly) : measure of confidence in attrSelf/Other. 
% aEvSelf/Other, possibly) : strength of belief re. how positive 'positive raters' and 
%             'negative raters' are. A lesser priority to explore, first set aEvSelf=aEvOther.
% alphaPrec    : Decision noise parameter
% genLR    : General between-blocks learning parameter
% repLR    : between-blocks learning param for 'repeat' blocks, eg. between 1st and 2nd 'Mary rates Me'.
% w0       : Overall positivity bias 
%      Next,           **** parameters that can be left alone in the first instance  ****
% wAttr    : Slope between attributes and behaviours. Initially fixed at 6, so that 
%            if the rater is '95% bad', and w0=0, then they will give a good rating only 
%            1/(1+exp(w0+(0.95-0.5)*6 )) = 0.063 of the time.
% lrnR     : Active-inference learning rate within blocks. Leave it alone at 1.

    % Rationale for learning attrSelf, attrOther between blocks ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    % 1. Before calculating likelihood, consider all the raters that have been 
    %    seen so far, and apply learning anew, based on the initial attrSelf and attrOther,
    %    f0s and f0o for short. The learning rate genLR is appliced per individual. 
    % 2. We assume that the posteriors about each rater fully capture the attitude of that
    %    rater for that block; that the respective priors have been washed out by the 20 trials.
    % 3. So, if we have raters u z1 y1 x y2 z2 v w, then just before y2, say self is being rated, 
    %    apply all the prediction errors that would have been encountered as follows:
    %    f0s' <- f0s'+genLR*D(Pk,f0*);   for k in u, z, x,  i.e., NOT y1   and where f0* 
    %    is the f0 appropritate to that D. So we need to update f0s AND f0o for u, z, x
    % 4. when we are about to calculate y2, we do
    %    f0sTemp <- (1-repLR)*f0s + repLR*Py1 
    % 5. When about to do z2, 3. is applied to u,y (now (Py1+Py2)/2 ), x, then 4. from z1.
    %    (z1 is by now some way in the past but it doesn't matter).
    % 6. For v, 3. is applied to u, z, mean y, mean x, in that order.
    % Note that the prediction errors are calculated ANEW with respect to f0s, e.g.
    % f0s has been updated when D((Py1+Py2)/2,f0s) is calculated, but the posteriors are not,
    % following the approximation they are independent of the priors that were used to derive them,
    % ie. that the 20 trials have made minor changes in the estimate of the priors used to derive Py2 etc.
    % immaterial.      
    
        
     % just for completeness and checking - not needed for learning from block to block
